# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Sahana Vijay.
### ðŸŽ“ Senior at UC Santa Cruz, majoring in Cognitive Science and minoring in Computer Science. 
### ðŸ”­ Aspiring AI/ML Engineer and Data Scientist

At heart, I am a **researcher** who is passionate about **outreach**, **neuroscience**, and **machine learning**. I possess hands-on experience in end-to-end machine learning workflows, from data preprocessing to model deployment, following the **CRISP-DM framework**. I am skilled in harnessing **Python libraries** and **C/C++ data structures** to build scalable solutions. I have applied machine learning solutions across different domains such as technology, education, and business to drive data-driven innovation. As a Breakthrough Tech AI Fellow, I am gaining invaluable Data Science and ML expertise, especially in harnessing **Neural Networks for NLP and Computer Vision**. In the future, I plan on further exploring neural networks and expanding my general ML expertise!

# ðŸŽ¯ Current/Ongoing Project: Fall AI Studio project with Skinterest Tech

**What we are doing**: Implementing a Sentiment Analysis model to predict customer sentiment of skincare product reviews. Customer segmentation to identify different customer groupings based on product preference, skin type, and review behaviors.

**Tools, Languages, Libraries**: Google Colab, Python, Keras, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK.

**Results**: Stay tuned for the results in December!
